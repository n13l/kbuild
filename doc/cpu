 * IBM SecureBlue
 *
 * Secure Blue, data is encrypted and decrypted as it runs through a processor,
 * according to IBM.
 * SecureBlue is a secure CPU technology that is used to protect the 
 * confidentiality and integrity of information on a system from physical 
 * attack. In a SecureBlue system, information is in the clear when it is 
 * inside the CPU chip but encrypted when it is outside the chip. The 
 * encryption protects the confidentiality and integrity of code and data from 
 * physical probing or physical tampering. SecureBlue has been used in 10's of 
 * millions of systems where strong security is essential
 *
 * IBM has built a prototype of Secure Blue using its own PowerPC processor 
 * technology.
