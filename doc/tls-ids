Interaction with TLS Session ID

   If a server is planning on issuing a session ticket to a client that
   does not present one, it SHOULD include an empty Session ID in the
   ServerHello.  If the server rejects the ticket and falls back to the
   full handshake then it may include a non-empty Session ID to indicate
   its support for stateful session resumption.  If the client receives
   a session ticket from the server, then it discards any Session ID
   that was sent in the ServerHello.

   When presenting a ticket, the client MAY generate and include a
   Session ID in the TLS ClientHello.  If the server accepts the ticket
   and the Session ID is not empty, then it MUST respond with the same
   Session ID present in the ClientHello.  This allows the client to
   easily differentiate when the server is resuming a session from when
   it is falling back to a full handshake.  Since the client generates a
   Session ID, the server MUST NOT rely upon the Session ID having a
   particular value when validating the ticket.  If a ticket is
   presented by the client, the server MUST NOT attempt to use the
   Session ID in the ClientHello for stateful session resumption.
   Alternatively, the client MAY include an empty Session ID in the
   ClientHello.  In this case, the client ignores the Session ID sent in
   the ServerHello and determines if the server is resuming a session by
   the subsequent handshake messages.
