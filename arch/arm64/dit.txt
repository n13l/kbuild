Certain instructions on ARM64, including but not limited to those described in Arm Architecture Registers for Future Architecture Technologies, may take a different amount of time to run depending on the data values on which they operate. Malicious code running on the device might use this property to infer information about the data the CPU processes, such as cryptographic keys, or other sensitive data.

Apple silicon provides data-independent timing (DIT), in which the processor completes certain instructions in a constant amount of time. With DIT enabled, the processor uses the longer, worst-case amount of time to complete the instruction, regardless of the input data. When you write software specifically to avoid leaking internal information and to run code in constant time, enabling DIT — and restricting your code to instructions that support DIT — before loading cryptographic key material, performing cryptographic operations, or processing sensitive data ensures the timing of specific instructions doesn’t reveal information about the data being processed.

Enable DIT in specialized situations, such as cryptographic routines. Because DIT can slow down your code, only enable it in situations where you write software to run in constant time with respect to sensitive data, and to avoid leaking sensitive information. Apple cryptographic routines implemented in the operating system, and which are made available in APIs such as Apple CryptoKit, enable DIT internally.
