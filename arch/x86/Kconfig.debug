config OPTIMIZE_INLINING
	bool "Allow gcc to uninline functions marked 'inline'"
	---help---
	  This option determines if the kernel forces gcc to inline the functions
	  developers have marked 'inline'. Doing so takes away freedom from gcc to
	  do what it thinks is best, which is desirable for the gcc 3.x series of
	  compilers. The gcc 4.x series have a rewritten inlining algorithm and
	  enabling this option will generate a smaller kernel there. Hopefully
	  this algorithm is so good that allowing gcc 4.x and above to make the
	  decision will become the default in the future. Until then this option
	  is there to test gcc for this.

	  If unsure, say N.
