	bool "Enable Position-independent code"
	default n
	help
	Position-independent code (PIC) is code that can execute regardless of
	its absolute address (i.e. by using relative addressing).
	PIC is used for shared libraries, allowing library code to be located
	anywhere in memory.

config CC_STRIP
	bool "Strip executables"

	help
	  Strip all symbols and debug information from executables and
	  shared libraries during the build. This significantly reduces

choice
	prompt "Stack Protector buffer overflow detection"
	depends on HAVE_CC_STACKPROTECTOR
	default CC_STACKPROTECTOR_NONE
	help
	This option turns on the "stack-protector" GCC feature. This
	feature puts, at the beginning of functions, a canary value on
	the stack just before the return address, and validates
	the value just before actually returning.  Stack based buffer
	overflows (that need to overwrite this return address) now also
	overwrite the canary, which gets detected and the attack is then
	neutralized via a kernel panic.

config CC_STACKPROTECTOR_NONE
	bool "None"
	help
	Disable "stack-protector" GCC feature.

	Functions will have the stack-protector canary logic added if they    
	have an 8-byte or larger character array on the stack.                

	This feature requires gcc version 4.2 or above, or a distribution     
	gcc with the feature backported ("-fstack-protector").                

	On an x86 "defconfig" build, this feature adds canary checks to       
	about 3% of all kernel functions, which increases kernel code size    
	by about 0.3%.

	- uses register local variables                                       

	This feature requires gcc version 4.9 or above, or a distribution     
	gcc with the feature backported ("-fstack-protector-strong").         

	On an x86 "defconfig" build, this feature adds canary checks to

	  Modules are small pieces of compiled code which can be loaded

	  for zero overhead.

	  If unsure, say N.
