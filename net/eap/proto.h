 * The Diameter base protocol is intended to provide an Authentication,
 * Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) framework for applications such
 * as network access or IP mobility in both local and roaming
 * situations.  This document specifies the message format, transport,
 * error reporting, accounting, and security services used by all
 * Diameter applications.  The Diameter base protocol as defined in this
 * document obsoletes RFC 3588 and RFC 5719, and it must be supported by
 * all new Diameter implementations.
